            <td>It seems that everything that we needs in order to create Websites is already out there on the internet. We need to find what just fits in the project that we are working on. Proffesor Turner created a login page from scratch, however with a simple Google search I am sure I could have found something pre-made. I would just have to twick it in order to fit into the template of what I am working on. </td>>
            <td>I am learning AJAX and BOOTSTRAP. AJAX is not really something that has taken me time to learn. It is basically a way for developers to communicate, just with like plain English but it has it limitaions and a really specific format that I should follow.
                <br>
                These are the websites and videos that I used in order to learn more about AJAX:
                <a href="https://skillcrush.com/2018/04/26/what-is-ajax/">AJAX, </a>
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_ajax.asp">AJAX, </a>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82hnvUYY6QA">Video</a>
                <br>
                It is used to retrive and send data from a server at the same time without interfering with the Website's Template.
